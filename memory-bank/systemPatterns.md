# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern Next.js architecture with the following key patterns:

### Frontend Architecture

1. App Router Pattern (Next.js 14)

   - Server Components by default
   - Client Components when needed
   - Route-based code organization

2. Component Structure
   - Atomic Design principles
   - Reusable UI components
   - Layout-based organization

### State Management

1. Server State

   - React Query for server state
   - Prisma for database operations
   - Server Actions for mutations

2. Client State
   - Zustand for global state
   - React Hook Form for form state
   - Local component state when appropriate

### Data Flow

1. Server-Side

   - Prisma ORM for database operations
   - Server Actions for mutations
   - API Routes for external services

2. Client-Side
   - React Query for data fetching
   - Real-time updates via Pusher
   - Form handling with React Hook Form

## Design Patterns

### Component Patterns

1. Container/Presenter Pattern

   - Separation of logic and presentation
   - Reusable UI components
   - State management isolation

2. Custom Hooks
   - Logic reuse
   - State management
   - Side effect handling

### Authentication Pattern

1. NextAuth.js Integration
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Session management
   - Protected routes

### Real-time Pattern

1. Pusher Integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Event-based communication
   - Channel-based organization

## Code Organization

1. Feature-based Structure

   - Components grouped by feature
   - Shared components in common directory
   - Utils and helpers separated

2. Type System
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Shared type definitions
   - API type generation

## Testing Strategy

1. Component Testing
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for features
   - E2E testing where needed

## Performance Patterns

1. Code Splitting

   - Route-based splitting
   - Component lazy loading
   - Dynamic imports

2. Caching Strategy
   - React Query caching
   - Static page generation
   - Incremental Static Regeneration

## Security Patterns

1. Authentication

   - JWT-based auth
   - Session management
   - Protected routes

2. Data Protection
   - Input validation
   - API security
   - CORS policies
